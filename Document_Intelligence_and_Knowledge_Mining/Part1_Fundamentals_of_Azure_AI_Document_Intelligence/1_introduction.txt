Document intelligence describes AI capabilities that support processing text and making sense of information in text. As an extension of optical character recognition (OCR), document intelligence takes the next step a person might after reading a form or document. It automates the process of extracting, understanding, and saving the data in text.

Consider an organization that needs to process large numbers of receipts for expenses claims, project costs, and other accounting purposes. Suppose someone needs to manually enter the information into a database. The manual process is relatively slow and potentially error-prone.

Using document intelligence, the company can take a scanned image of a receipt, digitize the text with OCR, and pair the field items with their field names in a database. Document intelligence can identify specific data such as the merchant's name, merchant's address, total value, and tax value.

Azure AI Document Intelligence supports features that can analyze documents and forms with prebuilt and custom models. In this module, you explore how Azure AI services provide access to document intelligence capabilities.
