Generative AI is one of the most powerful advances in technology ever. It enables developers to build applications that consume machine learning models trained with a large volume of data from across the Internet to generate new content that can be indistinguishable from content created by a human.

With such powerful capabilities, generative AI brings with it some dangers; and requires that data scientists, developers, and others involved in creating generative AI solutions adopt a responsible approach that identifies, measures, and mitigates risks.

The module explores a set of guidelines for responsible generative AI that has been defined by experts at Microsoft. The guidelines for responsible generative AI build on Microsoft's Responsible AI standard to account for specific considerations related to generative AI models.
